## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The [AppDynamics Application Performance Monitoring (APM) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-appdynamics/) (PCF) allows you to easily deploy AppDynamics-monitored applications on [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://pivotal.io/platform) using an AppDynamics marketplace service. AppDynamics [Platform Monitoring for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/appdynamics-platform/) provides visibility into the PCF platform where your AppDynamics-monitored applications are deployed.

AppDynamics APM for PCF supports performance monitoring of application metrics. AppDynamics agent code embedded or bundled with an application instruments the application code and publishes performance monitoring metrics and other details back to the Application Dashboard in the AppDynamics Controller web UI.
