## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The AppDynamics integration with Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) allows you to easily deploy AppDynamics-monitored applications on the [Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

AppDynamics APM supports performance monitoring of application metrics. AppDynamics agent code embedded or bundled with an application instruments the application code and publishes performance monitoring metrics and other details back to the Application Dashboard in the AppDynamics Controller web UI.
