## <a id='GeneralFAQs'></a> General FAQs
### <a id='g1'></a> <a id='g1'></a> What is included in the AppDynamics Tile?
   * AppDynamics Service Broker (for application instrumentation)
   * AppDynamics Machine Agent (for collecting PCF metrics through a custom Nozzle from loggregator)
   * AppDynamics PCF Dashboard (An autogenerated custom dashboard that creates health rules for the above PCF metrics and neatly presents the resulting data)
   * AppDynamics Analytics (for transaction analytics)

### <a id='g2'></a> <a id='g1'></a> I am only interested in APM. Should I configure Machine Agent and Transaction Analytics?
   *  For now, provide dummy values in the tile forms. We are working with Pivotal to release a lighter APM-only product soon.

### <a id='g3'></a> How do I configure SSL (On-Prem Controller deployment) ?
   *  Make sure you have included the entire certificate chain in the security config of the OpsManager director tile. This will ensure that all BOSH deployments and Diego cells can access those certificates automatically while doing SSL validation.
   *  AppDynamics deployments automatically reads the certificates, and imports them into correct keystores. No additional steps are needed.
   *  Follow the exact format (no comments) as specified in the Pivotal OpsManager documentation.
   *  Make sure you check the all SSL check boxes in Tile Configuration Forms.

### <a id='g4'></a> How do I configure SSL (SaaS deployment)?
   *   AppDynamics SaaS Controllers are signed with standard DigiCerts CA. They are already included in the BOSH deployments and application containers.
   *   Make sure that you check the all SSL checkboxes in Tile Configuration Forms.

### <a id='g5'></a> My installation failed, what do I provide to AppDynamics Support?
   *  Collect the error logs from the OpsManager installation page and provide the entire deployment log.

## <a id='SBFAQS'></a> AppDynamics Service Broker and Buildpacks - APM FAQs
### <a id='s1'></a> What is AppDynamics Service Broker?
   *  AppDynamics Service Broker implements Service Broker API (https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker) and provides a credential service for applications to bind (https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/services/overview.html). When bound, the necessary AppDynamics configuration is automatically imported into the applications environment for buildpacks to read and configure AppDynamics agents.

### <a id='s2'></a> Can I bind to AppDynamics without the Service Broker and still instrument applications? (CUPS)
   *  Yes. You can bind a user provided service by creating a user provided service:
   *  `cf cups {service_name}  -p '{"account-access-key":"{access key}", "account-name":"{account}", "application-name":"{app}", "host-name":"{host}", "plan-description": "{plan}", "plan-name": "{name}", "port":"{port}", "ssl-enabled":{true|false}}'  `
   * Edit the values `{}` and execute the above command. This creates a user-provided service.
   * Bind the application to the user-provided service and restage.

### <a id='s3'></a> What language buildpacks have AppDynamics support included?
  * The following buildpacks are supported. The [AppDynamics documentation for Pivotal] (https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PCF) includes several step-by-step example workflows with sample applications.

### <a id='s5'></a> How do I customize AppName, TierName, NodeName?
  * AppDynamics Buildpacks autogenerates App/Tier/Node names by looking into the deployed environment. You can customize this autogeneration by setting the configuration environment variables.
  * To override the following environment, enter `cf set-env {APP} {ENVNAME} {ENVVALUE}`

| AGENT |	APPLICATION ENV VARIABLE |	TIER ENV VARIABLE |	NODE ENV VARIABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python |	APPD_APP_NAME |	APPD_TIER_NAME |	APPD_NODE_NAME |
| Java |	APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_APPLICATION_NAME |	APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_TIER_NAME |	APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_NODE_NAME |
| NodeJS |	APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_APPLICATION_NAME|	APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_TIER_NAME | APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_NODE_NAME |
| Golang |	APPD_APP_NAME |	APPD_TIER_NAME |	APPD_NODE_NAME |




### <a id='s6'></a> How do I configure the Java Buildpack to fetch a particular agent version?
  * By default, Buildpack fetches the latest available agent entry in `packages.appdynamics.com/java/index.yml `
  * You can override the default behavior by setting these variables specified under [Configuration] (https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/blob/master/docs/framework-app_dynamics_agent.md#configuration) in the [AppDynamics Agent Framework README] (https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/blob/master/docs/framework-app_dynamics_agent.md).
  * To use a specific version, just set the env JBP_CONFIG_APP_DYNAMICS_AGENT:
     + `cf set-env {YOUR_APP_NAME} JBP_CONFIG_APP_DYNAMICS_AGENT '{version: 4.4.111}'`
  * To use another package index, just set the env JBP_CONFIG_APP_DYNAMICS_AGENT:
     + `cf set-env {YOUR_APP_NAME} JBP_CONFIG_APP_DYNAMICS_AGENT '{repository_root: "https://exmple.duckdns.org"}' `

### <a id='s7'></a> The Java buildpack does not fetch a particular agent version. What should I do?
  * If you are using the default package index, verify that the version in question is present in the output of the following command:
    +  `curl -sSL https://packages.appdynamics.com/java/index.yml -H "user-agent: Ruby" -H "accept-encoding: gzip;q=1.0,deflate;q=0.6,identity;q=0.3" -H "accept: */*"`
  * If it does not show up in the output, reach out to AppDynamics Support (or) #java-buildpack channel of cloudfoundry slack


### <a id='s8'></a> My application push fails. What do I provide to AppDynamics Support?

  * cf push logs
  * Application manifest (if present)

### <a id='s9'></a> My application is running, but I do not see any metrics on Controller. How do I troubleshoot?

  *  Do a `cf env application` and see if the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable has AppDynamics information.
     * If no, bind the application to AppDynamics service and restage
     * If yes, make all the credentials (Controller info, key, ssl) are correctly set. If you are using SSL, make sure that it is enabled ("ssl: true") in `VCAP_SERVICES`

### <a id='s10'></a> What should I provide to AppDynamics Support ?
  * cf logs {appname}
  * cf env {appname}
  * cf ssh {appname}
      + figure out the process id of the running application by doing `ps aux`
      + cat /proc/{pid}/environ
      + Agent logs

| AGENT  | LOGS  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|  NODE.JS  | /tmp/appd/{hash} |
| JAVA   | /app/.java-buildpack/app_dynamics_agent/ver<agent_version>/logs  |



## <a id='MA FAQS'></a> AppDynamics Machine Agent - Platform Metrics FAQs

### <a id='m1'></a> What does the AppDynamics Machine Agent collect?
  *  The AppDynamics Machine Agent deployed via the tile collects various KPI metrics of PCF environment exposed via loggregator.

### <a id='m2'></a> How is the AppDynamics Machine Agent deployed?
  *  The Machine Agent deployed via tile includes a PCF monitoring extension that creates a custom Nozzle and collects all the exposed KPI metrics. It is deployed as a BOSH deployment in the opsmanager.

### <a id='m3'></a> How can I verify that the Machine Agent is properly deployed?
  *  Once the tile is configured and installed properly, go the application you have created to collect the metrics on the Controller. Open the Metric browser. In the metric tree you will see
    `Application Infrastructure Performance -} {Tier-Name} -} Custom Metrics -} PCF Firehose Monitor`
  *  If you find that folder, then the Machine Agent is properly deployed. You can use the custom dashboard for a cleaner view or use the Metric Browser to look at the detailed metrics without any health rules.

### <a id='m4'></a> How do I access the AppDynamics Machine Agent deployment?
  * Log in to the Ops Manager.
  * Find the AppDynamics deployment.
  * Log in to the AppDynamics deployment VM.
       * The Machine Agent root folder is at `/var/vcap/packages/appd_machine_agent_pkg`
       * The Machine agent configuration and control scripts are at `cd /var/vcap/jobs/appd_machine_agent_job`

  ```bash
    ubuntu@pie-20-ops-manager:~$ bosh -e gcp deployments | grep appdynamics
    appdynamics-50d1e026bc3e30178992            	appd_machine_agent/4.4.337           	bosh-google-kvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent/3586.16	-	latest
                                                  appdynamics/4.4.337

    ubuntu@pie-20-ops-manager:~$ bosh -e gcp -d appdynamics-50d1e026bc3e30178992 ssh

  ```

### <a id='m5'></a> Where are the logs for the AppDynamics Machine Agent?
  * The logs are present in the root folder of the Machine Agent in the AppDynamics BOSH VM deployment:  `/var/vcap/packages/appd_machine_agent_pkg/logs`

### <a id='m6'></a> How do I stop the AppDynamics Machine Agent?
  * The processes in the BOSH deloyment are managed by `monit`.
  * Enter the following command: `monit stop machineagent`

  ```bash
  machineagent_server_node/7fd4d170-a563-4828-bf19-063a4d1b6b34:~$ sudo su
  machineagent_server_node/7fd4d170-a563-4828-bf19-063a4d1b6b34:/var/vcap/bosh_ssh/bosh_f59d11e1eca346c# monit summary
    The Monit daemon 5.2.5 uptime: 4d 0h 17m

          Process 'machineagent'              running
          Process 'bosh-dns'                  running
          System 'system_localhost'           running
  machineagent_server_node/7fd4d170-a563-4828-bf19-063a4d1b6b34:/var/vcap/bosh_ssh/bosh_f59d11e1eca346c# monit stop machineagent

  ```
### <a id='m7'></a> How do I customize the Machine Agent configuration?
  * Edit the `Controller-info.xml` folder in the  folder `/var/vcap/jobs/appd_machine_agent_job/config`
  * Restart the Machine Agent: `monit restart machineagent`

### <a id='m8'></a> How do I start AppDynamics Machine Agent?
  * Use the monit script: `monit start machineagent`

### <a id='m9'></a> There is an SSL issue connecting to the Controller. How do I troubleshoot it?
  * The Machine Agent uses 3 SSL certificates in
    + trusted_certs.pem to talk to the Controller, which gets converted into cacerts.jks. Make sure your cert chain is present in trusted_certs.pem.
    + ca_cert.pem and cert.pem, which are used by Nozzle - these are autogenerated by OpsManager

### <a id='m10'></a> I am not getting any platform metrics. What should I double-check?
   + Make sure that SSL is properly configured.
   + Make sure that the application name, tier name and Tier-ID are properly configured.
   + See the Machine Agent logs and see if there are any errors.

### <a id='m11'></a> What should I provide AppDynamics Support?
  * Contents of the conf dir:
   `ls -al /var/vcap/packages/appd_machine_agent_pkg/conf`
  * Set the log level to debug by editing `ls -al /var/vcap/packages/appd_machine_agent_pkg/conf/logging/log4j.xml` and collect 10 minutes worth of debug logs.

## <a id='PCFDashboardFAQS'></a> AppDynamics PCF Dashboard FAQs
### <a id='d1'></a> What is PCF Dashboard?
  * The PCF Dashboard Generator is a Python 3 application that generates a platform dashboard and set of health rules for PCF foundations that have installed the AppDynamics Tile v4.4.x. The generated dashboard and health rules leverage the custom metrics published by the AppDynamics Tile to the AppDynamics Controller and application configured in the tile.

### <a id='d2'></a> Where do I find this dashboard?
 * Go to the Controller UI > Dashboards and Reports page > `{appname}-{tiername}-PCF KPI Dashboard`  where appname and tiername are the Machine Agent application name and tier name configured in the tile.

### <a id='d3'></a> How is this dashboard created?
   * The dashboard application reads the KPI metrics emitted by machine agent in the tile and associates them with various auto-generated Health Rules and renders a neat custom dashboard.

### <a id='d5'></a> I don't see this dashboard. How do I troubleshoot?
   * Make sure the application is deployed properly. You should see `appdpcfdashboard-version` running.

  ```bash
      pavan.krishna@OSXLTPKrishna:~/appdy$ cf target -o appdynamics-org -s appdynamics-space
      pavan.krishna@OSXLTPKrishna:~/appdy$ cf apps
          Getting apps in org appdynamics-org / space appdynamics-space as admin...
      name                       requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
      appdpcfdashboard-4.4.337   started           1/1         128M     1G      appdpcfdashboard.cfapps.pie-20.cfplatformeng.com
  ```

### <a id='d6'></a> Where do I find the logs?
  * Enter the command `cf logs appdpcfdashboard-{version}` in the org `appdynamics-org` and the space `appdynamics-space`

### <a id='d7'></a> How do I troubleshoot an SSL issue?
   * cf ssh  appdpcfdashboard-{version}
   * Make sure that the correct certificate is present in `/home/vcap/app/cert.pem` of the application:
     +  `cat /home/vcap/app/cert.pem`

### <a id='d8'></a> How do I change a configuration variable?
  * All configuration of the application is done via environment variables. To change a variable, override the following:
         `cf set-env appdpcfdashboard-{version} {ENVNAME} {ENVVAR}`
  * To list the variables, enter:  `cf env appdpcfdashboard-{version}`
